 * A display logic is a pure function which implements the logic for

 * order to accept the the display.
 *
 * example : [['endpoint1'],['endpont2','endpoint3']]
 *           To display you need (endpoint1) or (endpoint2 and endpoint3)
 *
 * @param {String[]} requiredEndpoints The array of endpoints we require in order the component to display
 * @param {String[]} availableEndpoints The array of all available endpoints
 * @return {boolean}
