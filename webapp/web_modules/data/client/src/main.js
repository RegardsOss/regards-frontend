 * Module Client exports all the common REST API Client to request informations from REGARDS backend server.
 * One client is created per microservice.
 * A client is composed with 3 components :
 * - Actions : allow to submit redux api actions to request informations from server.
 * - Reducers : allow to add into the redux store the results of the actions.
 * - Selectors : allow to retrieve from the redux store the results of the actions.
 *
 * The reducers are normally only used to initialize the global application Redux Store.
 * From the other modules of this application ou should only use Actions and Selectors.
