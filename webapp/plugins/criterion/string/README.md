# String criterion

## Description

This package is a REGARDS criterion plugin. It can be used, with other criterion plugins, to configure a search form module, allowing to search and display DATA in REGARDS user interface.

## Plugin specificities

String criterion allows user searching data on a string attribute value. It offers the following modes:
* **Search full word**: The data attribute value must worth exactly the user entered text.
* **Default mode**: The data attribute must contain the user entered text. User can search for multiple word parts in that mode, by separating them with a space character.  

It requires a string type attribute configured.
